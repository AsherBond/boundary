# AWS dynamic host catalogs
Boundary auto discovers AWS EC2 instances and adds them as hosts by using
dynamic host catalogs.

## Creating a host catalog to connect with AWS
Boundary uses a plugin system to integrate with different providers, so to use
a dynamic host catalog to integrate with AWS you create a host catalog of type
"plugin" and specify the "plugin-name" as "aws" along with providing specific
fields needed for boundary to authenticate with AWS.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

```shell-session
$ boundary host-catalogs create plugin \
  -scope-id $BOUNDARY_PROJECT_ID \
  -plugin-name aws \
  -attr disable_credential_rotation=true \
  -attr region=us-east-1 \
  -secret access_key_id=env://AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -secret secret_access_key=env://AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">

  ```hcl
  resource "boundary_host_catalog_plugin" "aws_plugin" {
    name        = "AWS Catalog"
    description = "AWS Host Catalog"
    scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
    plugin_name = "aws"

    attributes_json = jsonencode({
      "region" = "eu-west-2",
      "disable_credential_rotation" = true })
    secrets_json = jsonencode({
      "access_key_id" = var.aws_access,
      "secret_access_key" = var.aws_secret})
  }
  ```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

"scope-id" and "plugin-name" are fields the boundary requires when creating a
  dynamic host catalog.

The fields following the "attr" and "secret" flags are specific to AWS which
  Boundary needs to authenticate.

- "disable_credential_rotation": When true, Boundary will not handle the
  rotation of the credentials with AWS automatically.
- "region": The region to configure the host catalog for. All host sets in this
  catalog will be configured for this region.
- "access_key_id": The access key ID for the IAM user to use with this host
  catalog
- "secret_access_key": The secret access key for the IAM user to use with this
  host catalog


For more fields which can be used when creating host catalogs refer to
  [the domain model documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs)

## Creating a host set to connect with AWS
[Host sets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) specify which AWS
  filters should be used to identify which discovered hosts should be its members.

Create a host set using the following command:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets create plugin \
  -host-catalog-id $BOUNDARY_HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -attr filters=tag-key=foo,bar \
  -attr filters=tag-key=baz
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

```hcl
resource "boundary_host_set_plugin" "aws_plugin" {
  name        = "AWS Host Set"
  description = "AWS Host Set"
  host_catalog_id  = boundary_scope.boundary_host_catalog_plugin.id
  attributes_json = jsonencode({
  "filters" = ["tag-key=foo,bar", "tag-key=baz"] })
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

- "host-catalog-id" is a required field that specifies in which host catalog to
  create this host set.

Like with the host catalog, the fields passed in after the "attr" flag are
  fields specific to AWS.

- "filters": String filters in the format key=val1,val2. The key corresponds to
  a filter option, and the value(s) are a comma-separated list. For a list of
  filter options, refer to the
  [describe-instances in the AWS CLI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html).
  When the values in a single filters field are separated by a comma, either
  can be true for the host to match.  When multiple filters fields are provided
  they must all match for a host to match. In the above example an instance must
  have either tags "foo" or "bar" and must have the tag "baz".
